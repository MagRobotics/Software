# Magnetic navigation simulation design software

# Overall
A theoretical and implementable framework to analyze, categorize and identify ambiguity in magnetic pose estimation, which lays the foundation for optimizing configurations of magnetic sources and designing compact, energy-efficient, but unambiguous magnetic tracking systems with minimum number of magnetic sources.

# Dependencies and Installation
Download the software package and decompress it. The download path does not contain Chinese

For Windows7 or later, python3.8 can be installed

When installing python3.8, select Add python to environment variables

If multiple python versions exist in the system, set 3.8 to the highest priority

If you are creating a python3.8 environment in conda, you need to set the PYTHONHOME environment variable

Install two third-party libraries for python
```
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install scipy
```
If you need other functions in the application software, install the corresponding third-party python library

# Running
